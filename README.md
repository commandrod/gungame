# Gun game

 Reaction of the Gun Game gamemode on the TopStrix Network made with the Spigot API.

## Intents

>This plugin was made only for the purpose of making a Gun Game recreation with modified PvP, the old maps & more features that have been removed in the latest updates, that the community would love to have back.
>
Also, there is a version of the plugin made for 1.8 Minecraft Servers, to feel the true PvP experience.

## Installation

> The plugin has no releases yet, I will probably make a release once I'm happy with the code.

## License
>The project has no license, you are free to copy any pieces of code and use them for either non-profit or profitable use.
